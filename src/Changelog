	* Changed surface area calculations to account for how much of the dipole
	is exposed to the surrounding area.

2006-07-21  Hezekiah M. Carty  <hcarty@0ok.org>

	* ddscat raw output files are now saved to the database.  Still no
	analysis or processing on these files though.

2006-07-19  Hezekiah M. Carty  <hcarty@0ok.org>

	* Starting the process of saving ddscat output.  No analysis or processing
	has been started though.

2006-07-11  Hezekiah M. Carty  <hcarty@0ok.org>

	* Testing updates.  New script to automate some basic tests (TODO- remake
	it as a proper Perl test).
	* Test script parameters are now loaded from a YAML file rather than being
	hardcoded.
	* Lots of refactoring and cleaning up in the DDSCAT specific stuff.
	* Some minor tweaks to the IO system - mainly adding transactions.

2006-06-27  Hezekiah M. Carty  <hcarty@0ok.org>

	* Added support for CHECK constraints when building initial ScatWrap
	tables.  I also implemented several CHECK constraints for the ddscat
	parameters, though they likely need further scrutiny and not all listed
	options are currently supported by ScatWrap's internals.

2006-06-26  Hezekiah M. Carty  <hcarty@0ok.org>

	* Cleanups based on first run against DDSCAT 6.1 -- ScatWrap output now
	works when run against the latest DDSCAT!

2006-06-23  Hezekiah M. Carty  <hcarty@0ok.org>

	* Starting to use templates!  Template-Toolkit provides the goods for now.
	* Added a (working?) ddscat.par template, and the goods to parse it.
	Also, an example data set based on the example which comes with ddscat.
	* Many small cleanups.

2006-06-22  Hezekiah M. Carty  <hcarty@0ok.org>

	* Updating ScatWrap-IO module so that the load() function returns cleaner
	and more easily understood results.
	* Added a ScatWrap-DDSCAT routine to save shape data to the database.  One
	command!
	* Created a template for the ddscat.par input file.  Still need to fill it
	out properly, but that's easy!
	* Several more bits of code cleanup.
	* Trying to stick to some of the more readily available XP ideals - Key =>
	do the simplest thing that could possibly work.  This one could be a
	life-saver.

2006-06-20  Hezekiah M. Carty  <hcarty@0ok.org>

	* The Spiffy -> Moose transition should now be complete.
	* Added a ScatWrap-IO module which will handle the lowest level database
	IO.
	* Added ScatWrap-DDSCAT, which will hold the DDSCAT specific bits, and
	likely the next level of abstraction up from ScatWrap-IO.
	* Refactoring things around a bit to make sure functions are where they
	belong - mainly moving IO to ScatWrap-IO and ScatWrap-DDSCAT.

2006-06-14  Hezekiah M. Carty  <hcarty@0ok.org>

	* (In the process of) moving from Spiffy to Moose as an OO-base.  Also,
	general code cleanup and style fixes.

2006-06-05  Hezekiah M. Carty  <hcarty@0ok.org>

	* Switched command line option handling to use Getopt-Long.

2006-02-27  Hezekiah M. Carty  <hcarty@0ok.org>

	* Started a script for (re)building the initial database structure.

2006-02-19  Hezekiah M. Carty  <hcarty@0ok.org>

	* Database layout should be just about finalized now... for the next few
	days anyway.

2006-02-13  Hezekiah M. Carty  <hcarty@0ok.org>

	* Working on more database tweaks.  A little bit of cleaning up in the way
	table column information is organized.
	* Removed some items from the ScatWrap/Database/Parameters.pm table
	information to make way for a Shapes table.

2006-01-28  Hezekiah M. Carty  <hcarty@0ok.org>

	* Added a Class/DBI.pm class for a dda_runs table.
	* Added a basic (and probably broken/wrong) schema in for the dda_runs
	table.

2006-01-27  Hezekiah M. Carty  <hcarty@0ok.org>

	* More work toward database integration.  I have decided to put of the
	automated database building and whatnot until after everything is up and
	working properly.

2006-01-24  Hezekiah M. Carty  <hcarty@0ok.org>

	* Small ScatWrap/Shape.pm change - removed a stale 'use PDL;' since all of
	that has been moved in to ScatWrap/Math.pm.

2006-01-23  Hezekiah M. Carty  <hcarty@0ok.org>

	* ScatWrap/Settings.pm and settings.yaml added to start the process of a
	proper settings layout, making database changes easier and just generally
	making the setup more future-proof.
	* loadyaml.pl is a small test script for messing with the settings.yaml
	file.  loadyaml.pl should probably be moved in to a toys/ directory or
	somesuch, along with other test-but-useful scripts.

2006-01-17  Hezekiah M. Carty  <hcarty@0ok.org>

	* Started several database modules under ScatWrap/Database/*.pm which will
	make up the final ScatWrap/Database.pm interface.

2006-01-16  Hezekiah M. Carty  <hcarty@0ok.org>

	* Restarting ScatWrap/Database.pm using Class/DBI.pm to simplify the
	database interface.  This should make for cleaner code, and make things
	easier to update/maintain.

2006-01-12  Hezekiah M. Carty  <hcarty@0ok.org>

	* Started writing some ScatWrap/Database.pm code.  The basic
	implementation will be a class which ScatWrap/Shape.pm inherits from.
	More abstraction can be added later, but this should be good for now.
	* A few extra TODO items, and minor cleanup to code layout (newlines come
	and go!).

2006-01-11  Hezekiah M. Carty  <hcarty@0ok.org>

	* Minor bugfixes to ScatWrap/Shape.pm.
		* A few errors in the way the shape.dat information was being written
		to disk are fixed.
		* Removed an extraneous field (object_name) from the class.
	* Created a stub for ScatWrap/Display.pm.
		* It doesn't do anything yet, other than open and close a pipe to the
		gnuplot binary, and then tell the user to use gnuplot themselves...
	* ScatWrap/Math.pm - create_dipoles - changed the min and max values for
	x,y,z to always be integers to avoid some potential dipole creation
	troubles.
	* General code cleanup, commenting and note updating.
	* Created a stub for ScatWrap/Database.pm.
		* It doesn't have or do anything at this point.  Just taking up space
		as a reminder that there's still more to do.
	* Added a small, short script to test the existing code.  Current it loads
	a file and generates the fancy data and blasts the ddscat input out.  It
	also dumps the object contents out to a YAML file.

2006-01-10  Hezekiah M. Carty  <hcarty@0ok.org>

	* Crazy refactoring!
		* Code is now split in to modules under the ScatWrap hierarchy.
			* ScatWrap/Shape.pm houses a nifty class which loads and builds
			them thar bodies.
			* ScatWrap/Math.pm is where the mathy things lie.  Currently, it
			uses PDL.  If it comes time to use something other than PDL for
			math, this is the only module which needs changing.
			* ScatWrap/Display.pm does not exist yet, but will provide some
			manner of visualization for the generated dipoles.  The first
			incarnation will use PDL.
		* Using Perl6/Subs.pm and Perl6/Attributes.pm and Spiffy.pm to help
		make the code cleaner and more maintainable.
	* The 'monolithic' MakeShapeFile.pl is gone.
	* TODO list updated to hold some items which need doing.
		* There is still a LOT to do!

2006-01-05  Hezekiah M. Carty  <hcarty@0ok.org>

	* Turned on warnings to help in future error capturing.  This needs to be
	disabled for the PDL "use" statements because they throw a LOT of
	warnings.
	* Merged in some updates/cleaning from the Perl vs Ruby load_shape
	experiment.  Still plenty more to do, but it's a start.

2006-01-04  Hezekiah M. Carty  <hcarty@0ok.org>

	* MakeShapeFile.pl
	* Massive refactoring!  Lots more to come, certainly.
	* Code cleaned up using perltidy (see clean_code.sh) for consistency.
	* Moved/moving to using underscores (_) rather than CamelCase for routine
	and variable names. (in progress...)

2005-08-09  Hezekiah M. Carty  <hcarty@0ok.org>

	* MakeShapeFile.pl
	* Removed some extraneous, broken shape file loading functions.
	* Slight update to the usage information displayed.
