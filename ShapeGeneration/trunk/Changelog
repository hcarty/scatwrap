	* Crazy refactoring!
		* Code is now split in to modules under the ScatWrap hierarchy.
			* ScatWrap/Shape.pm houses a nifty class which loads and builds
			them thar bodies.
			* ScatWrap/Math.pm is where the mathy things lie.  Currently, it
			uses PDL.  If it comes time to use something other than PDL for
			math, this is the only module which needs changing.
			* ScatWrap/Display.pm does not exist yet, but will provide some
			manner of visualization for the generated dipoles.  The first
			incarnation will use PDL.
		* Using Perl6/Subs.pm and Perl6/Attributes.pm and Spiffy.pm to help
		make the code cleaner and more maintainable.
	* The 'monolithic' MakeShapeFile.pl is gone.
	* TODO list updated to hold some items which need doing.
		* There is still a LOT to do!

	* Turned on warnings to help in future error capturing.  This needs to be
	disabled for the PDL "use" statements because they throw a LOT of
	warnings.
	* Merged in some updates/cleaning from the Perl vs Ruby load_shape
	experiment.  Still plenty more to do, but it's a start.

	* MakeShapeFile.pl
	* Massive refactoring!  Lots more to come, certainly.
	* Code cleaned up using perltidy (see clean_code.sh) for consistency.
	* Moved/moving to using underscores (_) rather than CamelCase for routine
	and variable names. (in progress...)

	* MakeShapeFile.pl
	* Removed some extraneous, broken shape file loading functions.
	* Slight update to the usage information displayed.
