	* Turned on warnings to help in future error capturing.  This needs to be
	disabled for the PDL "use" statements because they throw a LOT of
	warnings.
	* Merged in some updates/cleaning from the Perl vs Ruby load_shape
	experiment.  Still plenty more to do, but it's a start.

	* MakeShapeFile.pl
	- Massive refactoring!  Lots more to come, certainly.
	- Code cleaned up using perltidy (see clean_code.sh) for consistency.
	- Moved/moving to using underscores (_) rather than CamelCase for routine
	and variable names. (in progress...)
